## Walmart Sales Data Analysis 

### Introduction 
This is a data analysis project that aims to explore and gain insights from Walmart sales data. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle, specifically the Walmart Sales Data provided by Kaggle user Ben G. The dataset contains historical sales data for different Walmart stores and departments.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Walmart sales data and extract meaningful insights to help identify trends, patterns, and optimize sales strategies. We will use SQL (Structured Query Language) to query and manipulate the data.

### Dataset
The dataset provided for this project is found in this repository as well and includes the following tables:<br>
Column	  -   Description	<br>
invoice_id   - 	Invoice of the sales made	<br>
branch   -	Branch at which sales were made	<br>
city   -	The location of the branch	<br>
customer_type	  -   The type of the customer	<br>
gender	-   Gender of the customer making purchase<br>	
product_line	-   Product line of the product solf	<br>
unit_price	-   The price of each product	<br>
quantity	-  The amount of the product sold	<br>
VAT	-   The amount of tax on the purchase	<br>
total	-   The total cost of the purchase	<br>
date	-   The date on which the purchase was made <br>	
time	-   The time at which the purchase was made <br>
payment_method	-   The total amount paid	<br>
cogs	-   Cost Of Goods sold	<br>
gross_margin_percentage	-   Gross margin percentage<br>
gross_income	-   Gross Income<br>
rating	-   Rating	<br>

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. This dataset contains sales transactions from a three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows:



### Requirements
To run this project on your local machine, you will need the following:

1. **SQL Database**: You should have a database server installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) that supports SQL queries.
2. **Database Management Software**: You need a software tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) to interact with the database server and execute SQL queries.
3. **Walmart Sales Data**: Download the Walmart Sales Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data) and import it into your database server.

### Project Structure
```
├── sql_analysis.sql       # Contains the SQL queries used for creating the neccessary tables and performing data analysis

```

### Running the Analysis
1. Import the Walmart Sales Data into your database server.
2. Open your favorite database management software and connect to your database server.
3. Execute the SQL queries to create the necessary tables, if not already provided, and to run the data analysis queries.
4. Update the database and table names as per your setup.
5.Review the query results to gain insights into the Walmart sales data.

### Conclusion
This project provides an opportunity to analyze Walmart sales data using SQL. By exploring and querying the data, you can identify key patterns and trends that can assist in making informed business decisions. Feel free to customize and modify the analysis based on your requirements. If you'll like to connect. I'll be most delighted to.
